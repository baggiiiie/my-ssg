# issues with v1

## This is a level2 header but it doesn't super work

header level doesn't work

## continuous line

right now different blocks are separated by `\n\n`, i don't really like that.  
i would like for different blocks to be able to be continuous. e.g.:  
this is a list:

- list item 1
- list item 2

but this doens't really work.

## line break

another thing that needs to be improve is line breaking.

now blocks are joined with r"\n", and replaced afterwards with `<br>`

`backslash n` is acting weird
